An End-to-End Data-Driven Approach for Predictive Analytics

Abstract

This project demonstrates the development of a complete machine learning pipeline for solving a real-world predictive analytics problem.
It covers the entire workflow â€” data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and deployment.
By leveraging supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, the project highlights how machine learning can be applied effectively to extract insights, make predictions, and support data-driven decision-making.

1. Introduction

With the rapid growth of data, organizations rely on machine learning to uncover patterns, predict outcomes, and enhance decision-making.
This capstone project applies advanced ML techniques to a real dataset to build an optimized predictive model.

Key highlights:

Development of an end-to-end ML solution

Integration of EDA, feature selection, and model optimization

Comparison of multiple algorithms to select the best-performing model

The final model demonstrates how properly tuned machine learning workflows can deliver high accuracy and reliability.

2. Objectives

The main objectives of the project are:
